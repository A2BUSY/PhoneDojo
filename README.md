# PhoneDojo

This is an application that allows users to upload phones and review them. It uses **express** as a server and **mongo** as a database I made this app to showcase my node skills.

**Note: It is still in development, more features to come!**

## Install
```
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm start
```

**Note:** Don't forget to add your environment variables in the ``.env`` file. Populate ``DATABASE_URL`` with a mongo database url.
